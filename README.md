## Dependencies
Must have Python 3.4.3 (32-bit) and NLTK already installed, with all packages.

## How To Run
Open a cmd terminal to the location of the project folder containing the following python scripts
`NLP_project_training_final.py`, `NLP_project_testing_final.py`, `naive_bayesian_algorithm.py`, `naive_name_algorithm.py`
and the text files `classification_training_set.txt`, `classification_testing_set.txt`, `tweet_training_set.txt`, and `tweet_testing_set.txt`

Then run the following commands:
`c:\python34\python naive_name_algorithm.py`
This is the initial analysis, using the baseline system. It displays the error rate on the terminal.

`c:\python34\python NLP_project_training_final.py`
This creates multiple text files needed for later scripts.

`c:\python34\python NLP_project_testing_final.py`
This creates more output text files.

`c:\python34\python naive_bayesian_algorithm.py`
This is the final analysis, using all improvements. This script gives you the error rate information on the terminal.
